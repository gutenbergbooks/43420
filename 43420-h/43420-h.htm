<p class="center b20 p6">OFF SANTIAGO WITH SAMPSON.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="s08">"KEEP OUT."</span></h2>

<p>It was a small but by no means feeble-looking boy who
stood in front of a driveway disclosed by the opening
of huge gates which, until they had been swung inward,
appeared to have been a portion of the high fence of
boards.</p>

<p>There was seemingly no inducement for a boy to linger
in this vicinity, unless, indeed, it might have been the
sign posted either side the gate, on which was painted in
letters rendered conspicuous because of the vivid colouring,
the forbidding words, "Keep Out."</p>

<p>"I'll not keep out 'less I'm minded to, an' him as can
hold me this side the fence needs to be spry on his feet,"
the small boy said, half to himself, and with a gesture of
defiance which told he had not been accustomed to obeying
commands that might be evaded.</p>

<p>Through the gateway nothing could be seen save
enormous heaps of coal, some enclosed in pens formed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
planks as if to prevent them from mingling with the
others, and between all a path or road of no more than
sufficient width to permit the passage of a cart. In the
distance, a rough building abruptly closed the view, and
beyond it the puffing of
steam and rattle of iron
implements told of life
and activity.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-012" id="i-012"></a>
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="257" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Outside the fence, it
was as if this certain portion
of the city had been
temporarily deserted; but
one could hear the rumble
of wheels over the pavements
on either hand, giving
token that the coalyard
was situated just beyond
the line of city traffic.</p>

<p>The boy gazed into the
uninviting-looking place as
if fascinated, only glancing
up now and then at
the signs which mutely
forbade his entrance, and,
as if unconscious of his movements, stole slowly nearer
and nearer the gateway until he stood directly on the line
that separated the yard from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"If I wanted to go in, it's more'n a couple of signs that
could keep me out," he muttered, threateningly, and then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
with one backward glance to assure himself that no unfriendly
policeman was watching from the distance, the
boy darted forward, taking refuge behind the nearest
heap of coal, lest an enemy should be lurking near at
hand.</p>

<p>Save for the hum of labour everywhere around, he heard
nothing. No guardian of the smutty premises appeared
to forbid his entrance, and after waiting a full minute to
make certain it was safe to advance yet farther, he left
one place of partial concealment for the next in his proposed
line of march.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, there was no other guardian of
the yard save the two signs at the entrance, and the only
purpose they served was to challenge him.</p>

<p>Grown bolder as the moments passed without bringing
to light an enemy, the lad advanced more rapidly until he
stood, partially concealed by one of the pens, where it was
possible to have a full view of all that was being done in
this place to which the public were not supposed to be
admitted.</p>

<p>If the intruder had braved the unknown dangers of the
yard simply in order to gratify his curiosity, then had he
paid a higher price than the view warranted.</p>

<p>The building, which from the street appeared to mark
the end of the enclosure, was a structure wherein puffing
engines, grimy men, long lengths of moving chains, and
enormous iron cars or boxes were sheltered from the sun
or rain. In front of it a wooden wall extended down
into the water,&mdash;a pier perhaps it might be called,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
at this pier, held fast by hemp and iron cables, lay a
gigantic steamer built of iron.</p>

<p>The intruder gave no heed to the busy men and
machinery within the building. The vessel, so powerful,
but lying there apparently helpless, enchained his attention
until he had made mental note of every spar, or boat, or
cable within his range of vision.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, from somewhere amid the chains, and
cars, and puffing steam, came the shrill blast of a whistle,
and as if by magic all activity ceased.</p>

<p>The engines no longer breathed with a heavy clank;
cars and chains came to a standstill, and men moved
quietly away here or there as if having no more interest
in the hurly-burly.</p>

<p>One of the weary labourers, his face begrimed with
coal-dust until it was not possible to distinguish the colour
of his skin, took from its near-by hiding-place a dinner-pail,
and came directly toward where the small boy was
overlooking the scene.</p>

<p>Within two yards of the lad the dusty man sat down,
brushed the ends of his fingers on his trousers, rather from
force of habit than with any idea of cleansing them, and
without further delay began to eat his dinner.</p>

<p>The boy eyed him hungrily, looked around quickly to
make certain that there were no others dangerously near,
and stepped out from behind his screen of coal.</p>

<p>"You'd better keep an eye out for the watchman," the
man said, speaking indistinctly because of the bread in his
mouth, and the boy replied, defiantly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to see the watchman 'round here that I'm
'fraid of, an' besides, he couldn't catch me."</p>

<p>"What'er you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'."</p>

<p>"A boy of your size has got no business to be loafin'
'round doin' nothin'."</p>

<p>"I might be eatin' if I had a chance; but there hasn't
been much of an openin' for me in that line this quite a
spell."</p>

<p>"Hungry?"</p>

<p>"Give me a piece of that bread an' I'll show yer."</p>

<p>"Don't you do anything for a livin'?" the man asked
passing the lad a generous slice from the loaf.</p>

<p>"Course I do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Anything that pays. I've sold papers some since the
Spaniards got so funny; but it ain't any great snap, only
once in awhile when the news is humpin' itself. A feller
gets stuck mighty often, an' I'm thinkin' of tryin' somethin'
else."</p>

<p>"Where's your folks?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got any to speak of now, since my father got
giddy an' went off to war."</p>

<p>"Out for a soldier, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! He shovels coal aboard one of them
big steamers that's down smashin' the life out'er Cuby,
that's what he does, an' he's nobody's slouch, dad ain't!"</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Teddy Dunlap."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Want more bread?"</p>

<p>The boy leaned over in order to look into the dinner-pail,
and then said, promptly:</p>

<p>"I've had enough."</p>

<p>"Don't think you're robbin' me, 'cause you ain't. I
believe in feedin' well, an' this is only my first pail.
There's another over there that I'll tackle later."</p>

<p>Teddy glanced in the direction pointed out by his new
acquaintance, and, seeing a pail half concealed by some
loose boards, at once stretched out his hand, as he said:</p>

<p>"If you've got plenty, I don't care if I do have another
piece of that bread."</p>

<p>"Can't you earn enough to keep you in food?" and the
man gave to the boy a most appetising sandwich.</p>

<p>"Say, that's a dandy! It's half meat, too! Them you
get down-town don't have more'n the shadow of a ham
bone inside the bread! Course I make enough to buy
food; but you don't think I'm blowin' it all in jest for a
spread, eh?"</p>

<p>"Runnin' a bank?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's kind'er like that; I'm puttin' it all away, so's
to go down to Cuby an' look after the old man. He allers
did need me, an' I can't see how he's been gettin' along
alone."</p>

<p>"Where's your mother?"</p>

<p>"Died when I was a kid. Dad an' me boomed things
in great shape till he got set on goin' to war, an' that
broke it all up."</p>

<p>"Did he leave you behind to run wild?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-017" id="i-017"></a>
<img src="images/i-017.jpg" width="381" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Not much he didn't, 'cause he knows I can take care
of myself; but he allowed to make money enough so's we
could buy a place out in the country, where we'd have an
imitation farm, an' live high. Oh, I'm all right, an' every
time I catch a sucker like you there's jest so much more
saved toward goin' down to Cuby. You see I never did
take much stock in dad's kitin' 'round fightin' Spaniards,
an' since he left it seems as if I was mighty foolish to let
him go, so I'm bound to be where he is, when things come
my way."</p>

<p>"Look here, Teddy," and the dust-begrimed man
spoke in a more kindly tone to the boy, "If your
father is a coal-passer in the navy, an' that's what he
seems to be, 'cordin' to your story, you couldn't see very
much of him, even though you was on board his vessel
all the time."</p>

<p>"Don't yer s'pose I know that? I ain't sich a baby
that I count on bein' right under his nose; but I'm
goin' to be somewhere near the old man in case he
needs me."</p>

<p>"It seems as if you might get down to Cuba easier than
earnin' the money to pay your passage."</p>

<p>"How?" and Teddy ceased eating for the instant to
look at this new friend who had made a suggestion which
interested him more than anything else could have done.</p>

<p>"Why don't you try to work your passage? Now, here's
this 'ere steamer, loadin' with coal for the navy&mdash;perhaps
goin' to the very ship your father is on. If you could jolly
the captain into takin' you to do odd jobs, it would be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
snap, alongside of payin' for a ticket an' trustin' to luck
after gettin' there."</p>

<p>"Well, say! That would be a great racket if it could be
worked! Is it a dead sure thing that the steamer's bound
for our war-vessels?"</p>

<p>"That's what, though it ain't to be said that she'll be
goin' to the very craft your father's on. All I know is
Uncle Sam has bought this coal, an' it's bein' taken out to
our navy somewhere 'round Cuba."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon any but them what enlists can go
aboard the steamer, an' the snap can't be worked, for I've
tried four times to get taken on as a sailor."</p>

<p>"But bless your heart, this 'ere craft is only a chartered
collier."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"I mean she's only a freighter that Uncle Sam has
hired to carry coal. You won't find enlisted men aboard
of her."</p>

<p>"An' do you really think there's a chance for me?"</p>

<p>"I can't say as to that, lad; but I'd make a try for a
berth aboard if my mind was set on goin' into that part of
the world, which it ain't. The captain went below not ten
minutes before the noon-whistle sounded, an' he's likely
there this minute."</p>

<p>Teddy gazed inquiringly at this new acquaintance for
an instant, as if suspicious that the man might be making
sport of him, and then marched resolutely toward the end
of the pier, with the half-eaten sandwich almost forgotten
in his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>After perhaps five minutes had passed, he returned,
looking disappointed, but not disheartened, and seating
himself by the side of the owner of the two dinner-pails,
resumed operations upon the sandwich.</p>

<p>"See the captain?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Didn't want a boy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Guess not; he said he'd give me two minutes to get
out of the cabin, an' I thought perhaps I'd better go."</p>

<p>"Quite natural, lad, quite natural; I'd done the same
thing myself. There couldn't have been any very great
harm worked, though, in askin' the question."</p>

<p>"It stirred him up considerable; but I guess he'll get
over it without any very bad spell," Teddy said, grimly,
and after a brief pause, added, reflectively, "It seems as
though some men hated boys; I've seen them as would
take a good deal of trouble to kick a feller if he stood the
least little bit in the way, an' I never could understand it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's more'n you in the same box; a
brute's a brute whether he be old or young, an' age always
makes 'em worse. It's a pity, though, that you didn't strike
one of the right kind, because if you're set on gettin'
down where the fightin' is goin' on, this 'ere steamer would
have been the safest way."</p>

<p>"Do you know when she's likely to leave?" Teddy
asked, after a long pause, during which he had been gazing
intently at the gilt letters, <i>Merrimac</i>, on the vessel's rail.</p>

<p>"Some time to-night, I reckon. We've been workin'
night an' day at the loadin', an' it's said that she'll leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the dock within an hour after the last scoopful has been
put aboard."</p>

<p>"How long will it take her to get there?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, lad, seein's I don't rightly know where
she's bound; but it shouldn't be a long voyage at the
worst, for such as her."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-022" id="i-022"></a>
<img src="images/i-022.jpg" width="536" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Again Teddy gazed at the gilt letters on the rail, as if
in them he saw something strange or wonderful, and when
the owner of the dinner-pails had come to an end of his
meal, the boy said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"Do you know the watchman here?"</p>

<p>"Watchman! I haven't seen any yet, though I reckon
likely there is one around somewhere; but he ain't agitatin'
himself with doin' much watchin'."</p>

<p>"Is the yard open all the time?"</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></p>

<p>"I haven't seen the gates closed yet; but most likely
that's because the work has been pushed on so fast, there
hasn't been time to shut 'em. Look here, lad!" and now
the man sat bolt upright, staring as intently at the boy as
the latter had at the gilt letters, "Is it in your head to
stow away on that steamer?"</p>

<p>"Sim Donovan did it aboard a English steamer, an' I've
heard it said he had a great time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon he did, if the captain was the usual
sort," the dust-begrimed man replied, grimly.</p>

<p>"I could keep out of sight a whole week, if it was for
the sake of comin' across dad," the boy added, half to
himself.</p>

<p>"That's what you think now, lad; but it ain't the easy
work you're countin' on. As a general rule, stowaways
get it mighty tough, an' I'd sooner take my chances of
swimmin', than to try any such plan."</p>

<p>"If a feller kept under cover he couldn't get into much
trouble."</p>

<p>"But you can't stay in hidin' any great length of time,
lad. You'd have to come out for food or water after a
spell."</p>

<p>"Not if I took plenty with me," Teddy replied, in the
tone of one who has already arrived at a conclusion.</p>

<p>"It looks easy enough while you're outside; but once
shut in between decks, or cooped up in some small hole,
an' you'd sing a different tune."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if it was a case of seein' dad when we got
there."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"But that's the trouble, my boy. You don't know
where the steamer is bound. She might be runnin'
straight away from him, an' then what would you do?"</p>

<p>"You said she was goin' to carry the coal to our
vessels, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but that don't mean she'll strike the very one
your father is workin' on."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chances," and now Teddy spoke very
decidedly.</p>

<p>For an instant it was as if the owner of the two dinner-pails
would attempt to dissuade him from the hastily
formed determination, and then the man checked himself
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I like to see a boy show that he's got some backbone
to him, an' it may be you'll pull out all right. It'll be an
experience you'll never forget, though, an' perhaps it won't
do any harm."</p>

<p>"How can it?" Teddy asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"Them as have tried it might be able to explain more'n
I can; there's no call for me to spend wind tryin' to tell
what you won't listen to, so I'll hold my tongue. I'm
bound to say this much, though, which is that you're
certain to catch it rough when the time comes for showin'
yourself."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right; I can stand a good deal for the
sake of seein' the old man once more."</p>

<p>Having said this, Teddy turned his head away as if no
longer inclined for conversation, whereupon the owner of
the two dinner-pails surveyed him admiringly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't wonder if you had considerable sand in you,
Teddy Dunlap," he said, musingly. "An' even though
it seems a queer thing for a grown man to do, I'm minded
to give you a lift along what's goin' to prove a mighty
hard road."</p>

<p>"Meanin' that you're willin' to help me?" the lad asked,
his face brightening wonderfully.</p>

<p>"It's little I can do, an' while I ought'er turn you over
to the police in order to prevent your makin' a fool of
yourself, I'll see the game out so far as I can. What
have you got by way of an outfit?"</p>

<p>"I don't need any."</p>

<p>"You must have food and water."</p>

<p>"I ain't broke, an' it won't be any great job to buy as
much grub as will keep me goin' for a spell."</p>

<p>"That's the same as all stowaways figger, an' the consequence
is that they have to show themselves mighty
soon after the ship sails. I ain't advisin' you to try the
game; but if you're set on it, I says, says I, take all
you'll need for a week, an' then perhaps there'll be a turn
in affairs that'll help you out of a bad hole. Here are my
pails; they're yours an' welcome. Fill 'em both with
water, or perhaps cold tea would be best; buy whatever
will be most fillin', an' walk aboard as bold as a lion within
the next hour. Them as see you are bound to think
you're waitin' upon some of the workmen, an' not a word
will be said. The hidin' of yourself is easy enough; it's
the comin' out that'll be rough."</p>

<p>"Say, you're what I call a dandy!" and Teddy laid his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
hand on the man's knee approvingly. "I was mighty
lucky to come across one of your kind."</p>

<p>"I ain't so certain about that. Before twenty-four
hours have gone by you may be wishin' you'd never seen
me."</p>

<p>"I'll risk that part of it, an' if you really mean for me
to have the pails, you'll see me go aboard the steamer
mighty soon."</p>

<p>"They're yours, my boy, an' I only hope you'll come
out of the scrape all right."</p>

<p>"Don't worry 'bout that; it'll be a terrible spry captain
that can make me cry baby when I'm headin' toward where
dad is. Be good to yourself!"</p>

<p>Teddy took up the pails, and as he turned to go out of
the yard his new acquaintance asked, solicitously:</p>

<p>"Got money enough to buy what'll be needed? If you
haven't there's some odd change about my clothes that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm well fixed, an' that's a fact. Ever since the idea
came to me of huntin' dad up, I've kept myself in shape
to leave town on a hustle. You're mighty good, just the
same."</p>

<p>"I'm makin' an old fool of myself, that's what I'm
doin'," the man replied, angrily, and then turned resolutely
away, muttering to himself, "It's little less than sheer
cruelty to let a lad like him stow away on a collier. There
ain't one chance in a thousand of his findin' the father he's
after, an' the odds are in favour of his havin' a precious
hard time before gettin' back to this town."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-027" id="i-027"></a>
<img src="images/i-027.jpg" width="352" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then a whistle sounded as a warning that the labourers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
must return to their tasks, and a moment later the building
was alive once more with the hum and whir of machinery,
the clanking of great chains, and the voices of men.</p>

<p>One of the steamer's hatches was already on and battened
down. A second was being fastened in place, and
the final preparations being made told that the enormous
hold had been nearly filled with the black fuel needed by
the war-ships.</p>

<p>Every man, whether a member of the vessel's crew, or
one of the labourers employed for the lading, was intent
only on his own business, and among all that throng it is
probable that but one gave any heed to a small boy who
came rapidly down through the yard carrying two tin pails
in his hands, and a large paper parcel under his arm.</p>

<p>That single workman, who was giving heed to other than
his own special work, nodded in the most friendly fashion
as the lad passed near where he was standing, and whispered,
gruffly:</p>

<p>"God love you, lad!"</p>

<p>The boy winked gravely, and then, setting his face seaward,
marched boldly up on the steamer's deck, glancing
neither to the right nor the left, lest it should be observed
that he was not familiar with his surroundings.</p>

<p>The man, who a few moments previous had been the
possessor of two dinner-pails, watched carefully as the
small lad walked rapidly forward, and only when the latter
was lost to view did he give heed to his own work, saying
half to himself as he took up the task once more:</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to blow on the boy even now, for it's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
a cruel shame to let him take the chances of stowin' away
with but little hope of ever findin' his father."</p>

<p>As if in pursuance of this thought he took a step forward,
and then checked himself, adding, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"It would be more cruel to stop the little shaver just
when he believes he's workin' his plan so smooth. Better
let him go his own course, an' trust that them he comes
across will remember the time when they were lads."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="s08">KEEP IN.</span></h2>

<p>Teddy Dunlap's father was formerly a coal-passer
on a steam-tug, and many times had the lad,
while spending the day with his parent, seen an ocean-going
steamer at close range, while the small craft went
alongside the larger one for business purposes.</p>

<p>At such times the boy seldom lost an opportunity of
boarding the big vessel, and thus it was that he had
a general idea of where he might the most readily find a
hiding-place this day when he was venturing so much in
the hope of meeting his only relative.</p>

<p>The dinner-pails and the parcel under his arm would
have done much toward warding off suspicion as to his
purpose, had any one observed him; but every person on
deck, whether member of the crew or temporarily employed
to make the ship ready for sea, was so intent on
his duties as to have no thought for a lad who appeared
to be attending strictly to his own business.</p>

<p>Even if any one aboard had observed Teddy particularly,
the natural thought would have been that he had come to
deliver the parcel and pails to one of the workmen, and so
long as the boy had been permitted to come over the rail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
it was reasonable to suppose he had due authority for being
there.</p>

<p>Teddy knew full well that his chances for successfully
stowing away in the vicinity of the main cabin, the engine-room,
or the deck-houses, were exceedingly slight, for such
places were visited by many; but down in the very eyes
of the ship, where were located the quarters for the seamen,
was more than one dark, out-of-the-way hole into which he
could creep with but little fear of being discovered.</p>

<p>Turning his head neither to the right nor the left, and
moving rapidly as if it was his desire to be ashore again as
soon as possible, the boy went into the forecastle&mdash;the
sailors' parlour.</p>

<p>The dark, ill-ventilated place, filled with noisome odours,
had at that moment no living occupants save the rats who
had grown bold through long tenancy. The crew were
all on deck, for at this time, when quick despatch was
necessary, no skulking would be allowed, and had Teddy's
friend with the dinner-pails attended to the arrangements,
the boy could not have had a better opportunity.</p>

<p>He might be even boisterously noisy, and there was
little likelihood any would come to learn the cause of the
uproar until after the steamer had left the coal-sheds to
begin her long voyage straight toward the enemy's islands.</p>

<p>Being in a certain degree aware of this last fact, Teddy
set about making his arrangements for the ticketless voyage
in a methodical fashion, there being no reason why he
should allow himself to be hurried.</p>

<p>The crew on board the good steamer <i>Merrimac</i> had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
neither better nor worse quarters than those to be found
on any other craft of her class; but to a lad whose experiences
of seafaring life had been confined to short excursions
around the harbour, this "sea parlour" was by no
means inviting, and save for the incentive which urged
him forward, Teddy Dunlap might have allowed himself
to become disheartened even before it had been proven
that he could take passage secretly.</p>

<p>"It ain't so <i>awful</i> tough," he said to himself, "an'
daddy will be all the more glad to see me after knowin'
I've had a hard time gettin' to him."</p>

<p>This last thought was sufficient to strengthen his failing
courage, and straightway he set about searching for a
hiding-place where he might remain concealed until the
steamer should come alongside Commodore Schley's flag-ship,
the <i>Brooklyn</i>, whereon was his father.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;but there would be time enough to form plans
for showing himself when he had nothing better with
which to occupy his attention.</p>

<p>The forecastle was well filled with sea-chests, bedding,
which as yet had not been put in place, and such like
goods as seamen would naturally bring with them on a
reasonably long voyage, therefore Teddy found it difficult
to judge as to what might be the general arrangements
for stowage after the steamer should be under way; but
he had good reason to believe it was necessary to find
some place so small that it could not well be utilised by
the men.</p>

<p>When, after some search, he came upon a narrow, dark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
doorless closet, partially filled with coils of rope, bolts of
canvas, and what appeared to be a general assortment
of odds and ends, it seemed as if he had indeed found that
for which he was looking.</p>

<p>There was little chance this small den would be required
for other than what it was then used, and he had only to
fear that some of
the articles it contained
might suddenly
be needed,
when he must of a
necessity be discovered
by whosoever
should be sent
to overhaul the
goods.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-034" id="i-034"></a>
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="364" height="414" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"I'll have to
take the chances,"
Teddy said to himself,
having considered
well this
possibility of discovery.
"It ain't likely they'll want anything out of here
till after the steamer is at sea, an' then it'll be too late
to send me ashore."</p>

<p>Once having decided that this was to be his abiding-place
during the time he could remain in hiding on board
the <i>Merrimac</i>, Teddy set about making such bestowal of
the goods as would best serve to his comfort, arguing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
himself that he might not have another opportunity for
putting the new quarters into decent shape.</p>

<p>Understanding that once the steamer was at sea she
would be tossed about by the waves until it might be difficult
for him to remain in whatever place he pleased, the
boy's first care was to make of the rope and canvas a
barricade to hold the remainder of the goods in proper
position, and, this done, there was little else possible,
save to unroll a bolt of the sail-cloth that it should serve
as a bed.</p>

<p>"It's a good deal snugger than I expected, an' the dark
part of it don't count," he said to himself, contentedly, as
he wedged the two tin pails filled with water, and his store
of provisions, inside the largest coil of rope. "When there
ain't too much noise I can hear the crew talkin', and that'll
help out big if a feller happens to get lonesome. Them
signs on the coal-yard said 'keep out,' an' I come in; now
I ought'er put up one that says 'keep in,' an' perhaps I'll
go out quicker'n I'm countin' on. Anyhow it's a case of
keepin' in mighty snug, 'less I want to run up against that
captain once more, an' I'm thinkin' he'd be an ugly
customer."</p>

<p>Teddy Dunlap was well content. He believed his store
of provisions and water was sufficient to keep both hunger
and thirst at a distance during such time as it might
be necessary for him to remain there in hiding, and when
the short term of imprisonment should come to an end, he
would be with his father.</p>

<p>What more could any twelve-year-old boy ask for?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>It was while counting up his reasons for being thankful
that the stowaway fell asleep, the heat, the darkness, and
the comparative quiet all contributing to make his eyelids
heavy, and he was yet unconscious when two noisy, bustling
little tugs, one either side of the big vessel, towed her
down the harbour.</p>

<p>The voyage had begun, and, apparently, there was no
suspicion in the minds of the officers that the <i>Merrimac</i>
had on board other than her regularly shipped crew.</p>

<p>When Teddy awakened he felt comfortable both in mind
and body; the steamer was rising and falling on the ocean
swell, but not to such a degree as inconvenienced him in
the slightest, and the many odours with which his nostrils
were assailed passed almost entirely unnoticed.</p>

<p>He believed, because of the pounding of the waves, that
the <i>Merrimac</i> was rushing through the waters at a sharp
pace, and this supposed fact was in itself sufficient to
counterbalance any defects he may have discovered in his
hiding-place, for the greater the speed the sooner he might
see his father.</p>

<p>Not until after he had been awake several moments was
it possible to distinguish, amid the varied noises, the sound
of human voices; but he was finally able to do so, and
became greatly cheered thereby.</p>

<p>"Now, this ain't goin' to be so bad," he said to himself,
contentedly. "I'll know everything that's goin' on, 'cause
it won't be a big job to crawl out far enough to hear the
men talk, an' a feller couldn't be better fixed, not if he'd
paid two prices for a ticket."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>Then the idea came to Teddy Dunlap that he was hungry,
and he laughed gently at the thought that it was only
necessary to stretch out his hand in order to satisfy the
desire.</p>

<p>"Talk 'bout your palace-cars! They ain't a marker
'longside this way of travellin'. I don't have to wait for
any tousled-headed nigger to bring my order, 'cause here
it is!"</p>

<p>Straightway the boy began to satisfy his hunger, doing
it in an economical fashion, for he was not minded to
exhaust his supply on the first day of leaving port.</p>

<p>He drank sparingly of the water, but yet taking sufficient
to quench his thirst, and when the meal was come to an
end lay back on the canvas bed luxuriously, congratulating
himself again and again, upon his determination to go in
search of his father.</p>

<p>The motion of the steamer grew more violent; but
Teddy was proof against such rolling as the <i>Merrimac</i> was
indulging in then.</p>

<p>There remained the same buffeting of the waves which
told of progress; told that the distance between himself
and his father was rapidly being lessened, and this was
sufficient for the stowaway.</p>

<p>The plunging of the steamer was to Teddy Dunlap no
more than the violent rocking of a cradle would be to an
infant; it prevented him from remaining quiet as would
have been pleasant, but did not drive slumber from his
eyelids.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes after having partaken of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
meal he was again wrapped in slumber, and during a
full twenty-four hours he alternately slept and ate; but
at the end of that time was more than ready for a change
of programme.</p>

<p>Then it was that his eyes refused to close; the folds of
canvas, which at first had seemed as soft as any fellow could
have asked for, became hard as iron, and he suddenly discovered
that he was sore and lame from having been flung
about when the vessel rolled.</p>

<p>The hardships of a stowaway's life suddenly became a
reality, and instead of congratulating himself upon being
on board the <i>Merrimac</i>, he began to speculate upon the
probable length of the voyage.</p>

<p>He hungered to hear the voices of the men more
distinctly, and spent full two hours gently moving the
dunnage around so that he might crawl out near the
entrance to this seeming cave.</p>

<p>When he had gotten so far into the forecastle that no
more than two coils of rope hid him from view of the
watch below, and understood it would be dangerous to
advance any farther, he learned that it was impossible to
hear any more than such words as were spoken in the
loudest tone. There was little hope of being able to
realise what might be going on around him by such
means.</p>

<p>Then came a most dismal twenty-four hours, when
the <i>Merrimac</i>, met full in the teeth by a gale of wind,
staggered, plunged, and rolled her way along, every wave
striking the iron hull with a force that caused Teddy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
wince, and then came that deathly sickness which those
who sail upon the sea are sometimes forced to endure.</p>

<p>There were many hours when the stowaway believed
the steamer was about to go to the bottom, and he fancied
death was the only relief from his agony. He even ceased
to think of his father, and considered no person save himself,
wondering why he had been so foolish as to believe
it might be wise to search for Commodore Schley's
flag-ship.</p>

<p>More than once while the malady had a firm hold upon
him, did he decide to throw himself upon the mercy of
whosoever might chance to be in view when he emerged
from the hiding-place, and perhaps if the sickness had
been less severe, his adventures would have ended as do
the greater number of such exploits.</p>

<p>Once having recovered, however, his heart became
braver, even though he learned that nearly all the water
had been spilled while the steamer was tossing about so
wildly, and his store of provisions, which had seemed so
large when he came on board, was nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>After this the hours passed more slowly, and each
moment the imprisonment seemed more irksome.</p>

<p>It was only with difficulty he could force himself to
remain screened from view, and more than once did he
venture dangerously near the entrance to his floating
cave in the hope of seeing a human face, but yet he
kept his secret forty-eight hours longer, when the provisions,
as well as the water, had come to an end.</p>

<p>He had ceased to speculate upon the meeting with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
father, but thought only of how long he could endure the
pangs of hunger and thirst, and even the fear of the commander's
possible brutality faded away as he dwelt upon
the pleasure of having sufficient to eat and drink.</p>

<p>And finally, as might have been expected, the moment
arrived when he could no longer hold his courage against
the suffering, and he made preparations to discover
himself.</p>

<p>How long he had been cooped up in that narrow place
it was impossible for him to so much as guess; he did not
try to compute the number of hours that had elapsed
since he last tasted food or water; there was only in his
mind an intense desire to receive the punishment for
having stowed away, in order that he might the sooner
satisfy the cravings of his stomach.</p>

<p>"It's no use to hold on any longer; the voyage ain't
comin' to an end for weeks an' weeks, an' I'll be dead in
another day if I don't have somethin' to eat. I'll go out
this minute, an' take whatever they give me in the way
of a floggin', for waitin' won't make things any better."</p>

<p>Having arrived at this decision, Teddy Dunlap began
to attack the cordage which screened the entrance to his
retreat as if each strand of rope was a deadly enemy to be
overcome without loss of time, and when he had thrown
down the last obstacle he stood blinking and winking in
the not overly strong light of the forecastle, confronted
by a short, round-faced sailor, who surveyed him in
mingled fear and astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;who&mdash;what&mdash;oh, a stowaway, eh?" the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
little man cried, after having expressed on his glistening
face, in rapid succession, fear, astonishment, and bewilderment.
"Well, I'll eat my hat if I ever heard of a lad
stowin' away on a collier what's out on an errand like
ours!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-041" id="i-041"></a>
<img src="images/i-041.jpg" width="382" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, I'm a stowaway, an' I don't care who knows it!"
Teddy cried, in a tone of desperation. "I held in just as
long as any feller could, an' it seems as if I was next door
to bein' dead, I'm so thirsty an' hungry!"</p>

<p>"You won't count triflin' things like that after you've
come face to face with the captain, lad," and the little man
appeared as truly sorrowful as any one of a like jolly
countenance ever can, however saddening the situation.</p>

<p>"Will he let in to me pretty tough?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin' that anything else you've had in that line
will seem a good deal like a joke, alongside of what he'll
deal out, an' that ain't the worst of it."</p>

<p>"What else can he do?" and Teddy looked up timidly,
absolutely frightened out of his hunger.</p>

<p>"This 'ere is the next thing to a government steamer,
seein's we're on naval service, an' the captain is like to
turn you over to the first cruiser we meet, for extra
punishment. I don't know how Uncle Sam treats them
as stows away on his vessels, but I'll go bail it ain't with
any very tender hand."</p>

<p>Teddy Dunlap looked around the forecastle, searching
for some one to whom he could appeal, for he believed
this jolly-looking little sailor was trying to play upon his
fears; but the sea-parlour was empty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>If he had waited forty-eight hours for an opportune
time in which to make his appearance, he could not have
come at a better moment.</p>

<p>"What's the use tryin' to scare a feller almost to
death?" he asked, piteously. "I've got to take the dose,
of course; but there's no need of your rubbin' it in."</p>

<p>"I ain't comin' any game on you, lad, an' that's the
solemn truth. While I never saw the captain of this 'ere
steamer till I came aboard, I'll eat my hat if he ain't a
tartar when you rub his fur the wrong way, an' I'm tryin'
to think if there ain't some way of gettin' you out of the
scrape."</p>

<p>"I'd go back into my hole if I had somethin' to eat an'
drink."</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>Teddy pointed to his late place of concealment, and
the jolly little man said, quite cheerfully:</p>

<p>"That's the very thing for you to do, my son. I don't
want to see you abused, an' it'll be hard lines if between
us you can't be got off this bloomin' steamer without
everybody's knowin' that you've cheated Uncle Sam out
of a passage."</p>

<p>"Can you get me somethin' to eat?" Teddy asked,
imploringly.</p>

<p>"I will if it takes every cent that's comin' to me in the
way of wages, to square the cook. Tell me what brought
you here, sonny? You can stand jest behind this dunnage,
an' we'll be able to talk quite comfortable."</p>

<p>That the little man would be a real friend there could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
be no doubt, and without hesitation Teddy told him the
whole story, neither adding to nor taking therefrom, and
saying, by way of conclusion:</p>

<p>"Of course it'll be all right when I come across daddy,
for there ain't no captain of a coal-steamer who'd dare give
it to me very rough while he was around."</p>

<p>"An' your father is aboard the <i>Brooklyn</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he shipped as coal-passer."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't rightly know what he'll be able to do
for you in case we come across him, which is doubtful;
but from what I've seen of skippers since this war begun,
I'm thinkin' our captain will swing a pretty heavy hand,
unless he meets some other feller who holds a bigger
commission."</p>

<p>"You talk as if I couldn't find daddy," Teddy interrupted.
"He's aboard the flag-ship."</p>

<p>"That's what I heard you say; but it ain't any proof
we'll come across him. This 'ere cargo of coal is goin'
where it's most needed, an' we may never find any of
Schley's fleet."</p>

<p>"But we're goin' right where the war-vessels are."</p>

<p>"See here, my son, Commodore Schley's fleet ain't the
only squadron in this war by a long chalk, an' we might
work at coalin' the navy from now till we're gray-headed
without comin' across him. I'm afraid the chances of
findin' your father are slim; but I'm bound to help you
out'er the snarl that bloomin' longshoreman got you into,
if it so be I can. Get back into the hole, an' I'll see
what can be found in the way of grub."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy, more disheartened because of the doubt expressed
as to the possibility of finding his father, obeyed
the little man's order without remonstrance, and once
alone again, gave himself up to the most disagreeable
thoughts, absolutely forgetting for the moment that he
had supposed himself on the verge of starvation a short
time previous.</p>

<p>As yet he had not absolutely divulged his secret, save
to the little sailor who had promised to be his friend, and
it might be possible that at some port he could slip on
shore without the knowledge of any save this one man.</p>

<p>But all such counted for nothing at the moment, in view
of the possibility that he had, perhaps, made the venture
in vain.</p>

<p>There was another and yet more alarming view to be
taken of the situation. He might be forced to go ashore
in a strange harbour, for it was hardly within the range of
probability that he could return in the <i>Merrimac</i> to the
home port, and then there was the ugly chance that possibly
there would be great difficulty in finding his way
back.</p>

<p>"I've made the biggest kind of a fool of myself!" he
wailed, very softly; "but I won't let anybody know that
I'm willin' to agree to it. When a feller gets into a muss
he's bound to crawl out of it an' keep his upper lip stiff,
else folks will have the laugh on him. It ain't so certain
but I'd better go straight on deck an' take my dose; the
captain won't be likely to kill me, an' the sooner it's over
the easier I'll feel."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>It is not certain but that Teddy Dunlap might have put
this new proposition into execution at once, had it not
been for the coming of the little sailor, who said, in a
cheery tone:</p>

<p>"Here you are, my hearty, salt horse an' tea! I reckon
you can worry along on that for a spell, an' meanwhile I'll
keep my weather eye liftin' for you. Things may not be
more'n half as bad as they look, an' even that'll be tough
enough."</p>

<p>"I've been thinkin' I'd better have it out with the
captain now, an' then I wouldn't be dreadin' it."</p>

<p>"What's the sense of picklin' a rod for your own back
when you may run away from it? Hold on here for a
spell, an' I'll get the lay of the land before anything
foolish is done."</p>

<p>"You're mighty good to me," Teddy murmured, softly,
as he took the hook-pot of tea and strip of cold meat from
the sailor's hands. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Bill Jones&mdash;Snippey, some of the hands call me
when they want to be funny. I reckon we'd best not do
any more chinnin', for the port watch will be in here
precious soon, an' there's more'n one man who'd make
life hot for you if he had the chance. I know what
sailors are, lad, seein's I've been one myself, man an'
boy, these thirty years, an' their foolin' is pretty tough
play for one like you. Lay low till I give the word, an'
if there don't seem to be any way out of this snarl within
the week, then it'll be time enough to let the old man
have a whack at your hide."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="s08">OFF SANTIAGO.</span></h2>

<p>It was really wonderful how changed everything appeared
to Teddy Dunlap after his interview with Bill
Jones.</p>

<p>As a matter of course there had been no enlargement
of his hiding-place, and yet it seemed as if he could move
about more freely than before. He was forced to remain
in quite as cramped a position, but it no longer seemed
painful.</p>

<p>Although the sailor had given him no encouragement
that he might succeed in the task he had set himself,
but, on the contrary, appeared to think it a hopeless one,
Teddy felt positive that the moment was very near at
hand when he would be clasped once more in his father's
arms.</p>

<p>He had come out from his hiding-place weak and
despairing, choosing the most severe punishment that
could be inflicted rather than longer endure the misery
which had been his constant companion during so many
days, and now, even before partaking of the meat and tea,
all was forgotten in the belief that he would soon be with
his father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>It was as if some other boy had taken Teddy Dunlap's
place, and this second lad was strong where the other
had been weak.</p>

<p>He made a hearty meal, rearranged his bed so that he
might be nearer the entrance to the hiding-place in case
the sailor found it necessary to communicate with him
hurriedly, and then indulged in more refreshing sleep than
had visited his eyelids during the past forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>When Teddy awakened, however, much of this new
courage had vanished, and again he allowed himself to
look forward into the future, searching for trouble.</p>

<p>He had no means of knowing whether it was day or
night, for the sunlight never came into this hole; but,
because of the silence in the forecastle, it seemed probable
the crew were on deck.</p>

<p>The steamer rode on an even keel, save for a sluggish
roll which told she was sailing over calm seas, and the air
had suddenly grown stifling hot.</p>

<p>Creeping so near the entrance that there was great
danger of being discovered by such of the men as might
come that way, Teddy waited with feverish impatience for
some word from Bill Jones, and it seemed as if a full day
must have passed before the voice of the jolly little
sailor was heard.</p>

<p>"Well, my hearty, you're in great luck, an' no mistake.
I wouldn't have believed things could have gone
so nearly your way, if I hadn't seen 'em with my own
eyes."</p>

<p>Before the sailor ceased speaking, Teddy had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
out from his hiding-place regardless of possible discovery,
and appeared to be on the point of rushing up the narrow
companionway.</p>

<p>"Hold on, you young rascal! Do you count on
jumpin' right into the captain's arms?" and Bill Jones
seized the lad by the shirt collar, pulling him backward
with no gentle force. "Where was you headin'
for?"</p>

<p>"Ain't it time for me to go on deck?" Teddy asked,
speaking with difficulty because of the sailor's firm
clutch.</p>

<p>"Time? I reckon not, unless you're achin' for a taste
of the rope's end. Our skipper ain't any very mild
tempered man at the best of times, an' this is one of his
worst days, for everything has been goin' wrong end foremost
jest when he wants to see the ship in apple-pie
order."</p>

<p>"I thought you said somethin' about my bein' in luck,
an' the only thing of the kind that could come to me,
would be to know father was on deck."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon you'll see him aboard the <i>Merrimac</i>
for some time to come, though you're nearer to him this
minute than I ever allowed you'd be in this part of the
world."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" and Teddy literally trembled
with the impatience of anticipation.</p>

<p>"Sampson's fleet is dead ahead. His vessels are the
very ones we've come to coal, an' if that ain't luck enough
for a stowaway, I'd like to know what you could call it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the <i>Brooklyn</i> anywhere near?" and Teddy did his
best to speak calmly.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Will we run right alongside of her?"</p>

<p>"I don't allow you've any claim to count on luck like
that; but we're hard by Sampson's fleet, and it'll be
strange if we can't find a chance of lettin' your father
know where you are."</p>

<p>"Find a chance? Why, I'll go right on deck an' yell
to him. He's bound to come out when he hears me."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-051" id="i-051"></a>
<img src="images/i-051.jpg" width="380" height="215" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There was in this remark something which struck Bill
Jones as being so comical that he burst into a hearty
laugh, and then, realising that his messmates on deck
might come down to learn the cause of such unusual
mirth, he partially checked himself, gurgling and choking
in the efforts to suppress his merriment, until it appeared
that he was on the point of being strangled.</p>

<p>"Go on deck an' yell to him," he muttered in the intervals
between what appeared to be spasms. "Say, lad,
it's precious lucky the weather is so hot that the crew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
have been driven out, else we'd had 'em all down on us,
for I can't hold in, no matter how hard I try. So you
think it's only a case of goin' on deck an' yellin', to
bring your father right over the rail!"</p>

<p>"He'd come if he heard me," Teddy replied, sharply.</p>

<p>"I ain't so certain 'bout that, for coal-passers don't
have the choice of promenading a battle-ship's deck.
The officers generally have somethin' to say about capers
of that kind. Besides, you might yell yourself black in
the face, even if the <i>Merrimac</i> was layin' close alongside
the <i>Brooklyn</i>, an' he'd never be any the wiser. You seem
to have the idee that one of Uncle Sam's vessels is
built something after the pattern of a tugboat."</p>

<p>"But I've got to get at him somehow," Teddy said, in
perplexity, the new and great joy which had sprung up in
his heart dying away very suddenly.</p>

<p>"True for you, lad; but it ain't to be done in the way
you're figgerin' on, an', besides, havin' come along so
smooth this far, I'm not countin' on lettin' you run your
nose against such a thistle as the captain is like to be.
It ought'er be enough that we've struck into the very
fleet you wanted to find, an' a boy what can't wait a spell
after all the good fortune you've had, ain't fit to be scurryin'
'round here huntin' for his father."</p>

<p>"I'll go right back into the hole, an' wait till you tell
me to come out," Teddy said, meekly, understanding full
well what his plight would be should this friendly sailor
turn against him.</p>

<p>"Now you're talkin' sense," Bill Jones said, approvingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
"I was countin' on cheerin' you up a bit, by tellin'
of where the <i>Merrimac</i> had fetched up, an' didn't allow to
set you off like a wild Injun. Hot down here, eh?"</p>

<p>"It's kind'er warm, an' that's a fact."</p>

<p>"So much the better, because the crew will stay on
deck, an' you'll have more of a chance to move around.
It's only a case of layin' low for three or four days, an'
then we'll see what your father can do toward gettin' you
out."</p>

<p>"How will you let him know where I am?"</p>

<p>"There'll be plenty of show for that if we come alongside
the <i>Brooklyn</i>; I can manage to send him word, I
reckon."</p>

<p>The conversation was brought to an abrupt close by the
appearance of a sailor's feet as he descended from the
deck, and Bill Jones turned quickly away, pretending to
be overhauling his sea-chest, while Teddy made all haste
to regain his "hole."</p>

<p>Now it was that the stowaway had every reason to
congratulate himself upon the fair prospects which were
his, when it had seemed positive that much trouble would
come before the venture was ended, and yet the moments
passed more slowly than at any time since he had voluntarily
become a prisoner.</p>

<p>With each hour his impatience increased, until it was
with difficulty he could force himself to remain in
hiding.</p>

<p>While he believed his father was very far away, there
appeared good reason for remaining hidden; but now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
with the <i>Brooklyn</i> close at hand, it seemed as if he must
make his whereabouts known without loss of time.</p>

<p>Fear as to what terrible punishment the captain of the
<i>Merrimac</i> might inflict, however, kept him in his proper
place, and before many hours passed Bill Jones brought
him further intelligence.</p>

<p>"The <i>New York</i> is to take on the first of the coal," he
said, leaning over the barricade of rope, and whispering
to the impatient prisoner. "I'm thinkin' we'll get around
to the <i>Brooklyn</i> before all the cargo is gone, an' then this
game of hide will come to an end&mdash;if your father is
a smarter man than the average of us."</p>

<p>The jolly little sailor had no time to say more, for one
of the petty officers interrupted the stolen interview by
calling loudly for "Bill Jones," and while obeying the
summons the sailor muttered to himself, "I wish the boy
was well clear of this steamer; it seems as if he was
under my wing, so to speak, an' I can't make out how
any man, lower in rank than a full-fledged captain, can take
him aboard one of Uncle Sam's ships."</p>

<p>Fortunately Teddy had no misgivings as to the future,
after his father had been made aware of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>He believed it would be the most natural thing in the
world for him to step on board the <i>Brooklyn</i> as a guest,
and the possibility that a coal-passer might not be allowed to
invite his friends to visit him never entered the lad's mind.</p>

<p>Bill Jones, however, was seriously troubled as to the
outcome of the affair, as has been seen.</p>

<p>He had promised to aid the stowaway, as he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
promised to aid any other lad in trouble, for the jolly little
sailor was one ever ready to relieve the distress of others,
no matter how great might be the cost to himself; and
now, having taken the case in hand, his anxiety of mind
was great, because he was by no means as certain of his
ability to carry it through successfully as he would have
Teddy believe.</p>

<p>Within four hours after the sailor reported that the
<i>Merrimac</i> would speedily begin to take out her cargo,
the prisoner in the forecastle became aware that the
steamer was at a standstill.</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving port the screw was
motionless, and the absence of that pounding which
marked the revolutions of the shaft caused a silence
that for a few moments seemed almost painful.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, when Bill Jones came to bring a
fresh supply of provisions and water, he reported that the
<i>New York</i> was taking on coal.</p>

<p>"The other ships are certain to need a supply, an' we're
bound to come alongside the <i>Brooklyn</i> sooner or later," he
said, cheerily, and Teddy replied, with a sigh:</p>

<p>"It seems like a terribly long while to wait; but I s'pose
I can stand it."</p>

<p>"I reckon it's a case of havin' to, lad, unless you're
willin' to take the captain's medicine, an' that's what
I wouldn't like to tackle."</p>

<p>"It's as if I'd been here a full month, an' accordin' to
what you say I'm mighty lucky if I have to stay only two
or three days more."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>"You're lucky if you get out in a week, so don't go to
countin' the minutes, or time will be long in passin'."</p>

<p>Twice during the next twenty-four hours did Teddy
have an opportunity of speaking with his friend, and
then he knew that the <i>Merrimac</i> was alongside the
<i>Massachusetts</i>.</p>

<p>"You see we're goin' the rounds of the fleet, an' it's
only a question of the coal holdin' out, to finally bring us
to the <i>Brooklyn</i>," Bill Jones said, hurriedly, for there was
no opportunity of lengthy conversations while the crew
were engaged in transferring the fuel.</p>

<p>Another long time of waiting, and Bill Jones appeared
at the entrance to the hiding-place in a state of the
greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"Somethin's got to be done right away, lad, an' I'm
clean beat as to how we'll figger it out. This 'ere steamer
is goin' to be sunk!"</p>

<p>"Sunk!" Teddy cried in alarm, clutching Bill frantically
by the arm, as if believing the <i>Merrimac</i> was even
then on the point of going down.</p>

<p>"That's jest it, an' we're to be shifted to the other
vessels, gettin' a berth wherever one can be found."</p>

<p>"What will make her sink?"</p>

<p>"She's to be blowed up! Wrecked in the harbour of
Santiago de Cuba, so the Spaniards who are inside can't
get out!"</p>

<p>Teddy looked around him in bewilderment and alarm,
understanding not one word of the brief explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-057" id="i-057"></a>
<img src="images/i-057.jpg" width="376" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"You see the Spanish fleet is inside the harbour, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
mouth of it ain't more'n three hundred feet wide. This
steamer will be blowed up right across the channel, an'
there the Spaniards are, bottled up tight till our fleet gets
ready to knock 'em into splinters."</p>

<p>"But what'll become of me? I'll have to face the
captain after all!"</p>

<p>"I reckon there's no help for it, lad, because it don't
stand to reason that you want to go down with the ship."</p>

<p>"How long before you'll sink her?"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> sha'n't have anything to do with it, lad. It's what
you might call a precious fine job, an' 'cordin' to the way
everybody looks at it, them who do the work ain't likely
to come back again."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Look here, lad, if you was goin' on deck an' set off
three or four torpedoes under your very feet, what do you
think would be the show of gettin' ashore alive?"</p>

<p>Teddy made no effort to weigh the chances; his own
affairs were in such a precarious condition that there was
no room in his mind for anything else.</p>

<p>"I'd better have gone to the captain when I first made
up my mind that it had to be done, an' it would be over by
this time," he said, with a long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been over till you got ashore, because
pretty nigh every sailor thinks it his bounden duty to
make things lively for a stowaway. You've saved yourself
from bein' kicked an' thumped jest so many days as I've
been coddlin' you up, an' there's a good deal in that."</p>

<p>"Are we anywhere near the <i>Brooklyn</i>?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"She was five or six miles away when I saw her last&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Five or six miles!"</p>

<p>"Yes; did you allow she laid within hail?"</p>

<p>"I thought from what you said that we was right among
the fleet."</p>

<p>"So we are, lad; but these big ships don't huddle very
close together, an' ten miles off is called bein' mighty near
at hand. I can't stop here chinnin' much longer, so listen
sharp. When the time comes, an' it's precious near at
hand now, you'll have walk up to the medicine-box like a
little man, so kind'er be bracin' yourself for what's sure to
happen. I'll watch till the captain appears to be in good
humour, an' out you pop."</p>

<p>Teddy nodded his head; there was too much sorrow
and disappointment in his heart to permit of speech, and
Bill Jones was so pressed for time that he failed to give
due heed to the boy's mental condition.</p>

<p>"Be ready when I come back next time!" the sailor
whispered, warningly, and then ran on deck, leaving the
stowaway in a most unenviable frame of mind.</p>

<p>When Teddy's mouth was parched with thirst, and his
stomach craving for food, he had brought himself to
believe that he could submit without a murmur to whatever
punishment the captain might see fit to inflict; but
now it seemed different. During a very long time he had
been cheering himself with the belief that before the close
of this hour or the next he would be with his father, and
such a sudden and startling change in affairs caused him
deepest despair.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>Crawling into the narrow hiding-place, he gave full sway
to the grief which had come upon him like a torrent, for
once Captain Miller knew of his having stowed away, so
he argued to himself, there would no longer be any hope
of communicating with his father.</p>

<p>To his mind he had not only failed in the purpose set
himself, but would be more widely separated from his
father than ever before, and it is little wonder, with such
belief in his heart, that the boy ceased longer to battle
against his sorrow.</p>

<p>He was lying face downward upon the canvas when Bill
Jones came to announce that the moment had arrived
when he should brave the ordeal of facing Captain Miller,
and the sailor was forced to speak several times in a loud
tone before the lad realised that his friend was near at
hand.</p>

<p>"Come, Teddy," the little sailor said, soothingly, "it'll
be over after awhile, an' perhaps won't be so bad as we've
figgered, for the old man ain't tearin' 'round dreadful mad.
Let's get on deck in a hurry, so's not to think about it
too long, an' I'll stand right by your side till matters are
settled one way or the other."</p>

<p>"I might as well stay right here, an' be sunk when the
steamer goes down," the boy wailed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, lad; after havin' the pluck to come thus far
in search of your father, you mustn't lose heart now. Be
a man, Teddy, an' count on me for a friend so long as the
trouble lasts."</p>

<p>It was not possible for Bill Jones to arouse the boy to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
proper show of courage until after fully half an hour had
passed, and then the two came out into the sunlight, both
looking much as if having just been detected in the most
heinous of crimes.</p>

<p>The dazzling sunlight nearly blinded the boy, who had
been shrouded in darkness so many days, and forced him
to cover his eyes; therefore he failed to see the look of
surprise and bewilderment on Bill Jones's face immediately
they came on deck.</p>

<p>During several moments he was in such a daze as to be
virtually unconscious, and then he heard his companion
ask:</p>

<p>"Where is the <i>Merrimac's</i> crew?"</p>

<p>"They've been set aboard the <i>New York</i> for a spell,
seein's how this ain't likely to be a very pleasant craft to
sail in after we get through with her," a strange voice
replied, and Teddy opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The deck of the collier appeared to be thronged with
sailors in naval costume, all of whom were apparently
bent on doing the greatest amount of destruction in the
shortest possible space of time.</p>

<p>Not far away to windward was a huge war-vessel, looking
more like some submarine monster than anything built by
man, and in the distance others of the same kind, cruising
to and fro, or lying quietly upon the ocean, rising and falling
with the heavy swell.</p>

<p>All this picture Teddy took in with a single glance, and
then his attention was diverted by Bill Jones, who said to
the sailor with whom he had first spoken:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't we to take our dunnage out?"</p>

<p>"I reckon that'll be done after a spell; but just now
it's a case of hurry, an' what a few old shellbacks like
you may consider dunnage, ain't taken into account."</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Miller?"</p>

<p>"I saw him goin' toward the flag-ship. It seems he's
got the biggest kind of a bee in his bonnet because Lieutenant
Hobson is to be given the chance of killin' himself
an' his crew, when he claims the right because of havin'
been in command of this 'ere collier."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-063" id="i-063"></a>
<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="550" height="399" alt="" />

</div>
<p>Teddy was wholly at a loss to understand the meaning
of the conversation, and he looked at the little sailor, who
now appeared perplexed rather than jolly, until the latter
said, speaking slowly, as if in a maze of bewilderment and
doubt:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm all at sea, lad, about this 'ere business; but it
begins to look as if you wouldn't have any very hard time
with the old man to-day. He's got somethin' else on his
mind that's of more importance than a worthless little
stowaway like you."</p>

<p>"He'll come back, won't he?" Teddy asked, yet unable
to gather any clear idea of the situation.</p>

<p>"Unless he comes soon, there won't be anything left of
the <i>Merrimac</i>, an' that's a fact," Bill Jones replied, pointing
here and there to where a hundred men or more were
busily at work, seemingly trying to make a wreck of the
collier. "I s'pose they're bent on gettin' out of the old
hooker all that's of any value, before sinkin' her, an' it
looks as if they'd finish the job in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Where's the <i>Brooklyn</i>?"</p>

<p>"See here, my son, we've no time to bother our heads
about her just now. It's enough for you that we can't
get speech with your father, an' unless I'm way off my
reckonin', here's the chance to pull out of what promised
to be a bad scrape for you."</p>

<p>Teddy remained silent, for the very good reason that
he was at a loss for words, and after a short pause, Bill
Jones exclaimed, as if a happy thought had at that instant
come into his mind:</p>

<p>"Hark you, lad, our men have gone over to the <i>New
York</i>, an' so long as we don't follow them it'll be plain
sailin'. We'll watch our chance, go aboard the nearest
ship, so it ain't the admiral's flag-ship, as bold as lions, an'
it'll be believed that you belong to our crew. Unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Captain Miller shows himself, you'll be livin' on the fat of
the land."</p>

<p>"But when he comes?"</p>

<p>"We won't bother our heads about anything of the
kind. It's enough for us to know you've slipped out of
the smallest kind of a hole without a scratch, and we'll
take all the enjoyment that comes our way, at Uncle
Sam's expense."

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="s08">THE MERRIMAC.</span></h2>

<p>There was no good reason why, as Bill Jones had
suggested, Teddy could not successfully pose as one
of the <i>Merrimac's</i> crew.</p>

<p>The undertaking in hand was so important, with such
great advantages to be derived from its accomplishment,
that for the time being it was as if every officer and man
in the American squadron had no thought save concerning
the work upon the steamer to be sunk.</p>

<p>That the situation may be made more plain, as it was
to Teddy before he had been on board the <i>Texas</i> two
hours, the following description of the daring venture is
quoted from an article written the very day Bill Jones and
his protégé sought shelter on the battle-ship:<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"The mines in the narrow, tortuous channel, and the
elevation of the forts and batteries, which must increase
the effectiveness of the enemy's fire, and at the same time
decrease that of our own, reinforced by the guns of the
Spanish fleet inside, make the harbour, as it now appears,
almost impregnable. Unless the entrance is countermined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
it would be folly to attempt to force its passage with our
ships.</p>

<p>"But the Spanish fleet is bottled up, and a plan is being
considered to drive in the cork. If that is done, the next
news may be a thrilling story of closing the harbour. It
would release a part of our fleet, and leave the Spaniards
to starve and rot until they were ready to hoist the white
flag.</p>

<p>"'To drive in the cork,' was the subject nearest Rear-Admiral
Sampson's heart, and he at once went into consultation
with his officers as to how it could best be done.
One plan after another was discussed and rejected, and
then Assistant Naval Constructor Richmond Pearson
Hobson proposed that the big collier <i>Merrimac</i>, which
then had on board about six hundred tons of coal, be
sunk across the channel in such a manner as to completely
block it.</p>

<p>"The plan was a good one; but yet it seemed certain
death for those who should attempt to carry it out as
proposed. Lieutenant Hobson, however, claimed that, if
the scheme was accepted, he should by right be allowed
to take command of the enterprise.</p>

<p>"The end to be attained was so great that Admiral
Sampson decided that the lives of six or seven men could
not be allowed to outweigh the advantage to be gained,
and Lieutenant Hobson was notified that his services
were accepted; the big steamer was at his disposal to do
with as he saw fit."</p>

<p>This was the work which had been begun when Bill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Jones brought Teddy Dunlap on deck that he might
confess to being a stowaway, and it is little wonder that
matters on board the collier were in seeming confusion.</p>

<p>On the night previous Lieutenant Hobson had received
the notification that his services were accepted, and at an
early hour next morning the work of making the <i>Merrimac</i>
ready for destruction had begun.</p>

<p>A dozen boys would have attracted no attention just
then, and the lad, who had mentally nerved himself to
meet the captain of the steamer, failed in finding any one
to hear his confession.</p>

<p>Bill Jones,
however, was
quick to see the
possible advantage
to be gained,
and Teddy had
not fully recovered from his bewilderment before the
little sailor was forcing him over the rail into one of the
<i>Texas's</i> boats, which had just come alongside.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-068" id="i-068"></a>
<img src="images/i-068.jpg" width="377" height="208" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Turned out of house an' home, eh?" one of the
sailors asked, with a laugh, and there was no question but
that the boy, as well as the man, had a right to be taken
aboard the battle-ship.</p>

<p>The officers had all left the boat, therefore the two were
not subjected to any searching examination, and once on
board the big vessel, it was supposed, as a matter of course,
that they had been regularly detailed to that ship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, these two who had but just
come from the <i>Merrimac</i> knew less regarding her proposed
ending than any other, and, therefore, were most deeply
interested in such information as was to be picked up
from the crew.</p>

<p>Before having been on board an hour they knew as
much as has been set down at the beginning of this chapter,
and, for the time being at least, they, like all around
them, had little thought save for the daring adventure
which was to be made by Lieutenant Hobson and six men.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty brave thing to do," Bill Jones said confidentially
to Teddy as the two were on the gun-deck,
having concluded a most satisfactory repast; "but I
wouldn't want a hand in it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Teddy asked, in surprise, for he had been
turning the matter over in his mind until having come
almost to envy those who were to brave death in the
service of their country.</p>

<p>"Because I ain't what might rightly be called a fightin'
man; owin' to my bein' undersized, most likely. I take
real pride in the deeds of others, but can't seem to get
my own courage where it belongs. I'm only what you
might call a plain, every-day sailor, with no fightin' timber
in me, else I'd been in the navy long before this."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will live to sink the <i>Merrimac</i>?"
Teddy asked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt in my mind but that they'll hold on
to life long enough to do the work, but it's afterward that
the trouble will begin. Every Spanish gun within range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
will open fire on 'em, an' what chance have they got of
comin' out alive?"</p>

<p>"When will they start?"</p>

<p>"It'll be quite a spell before they get the steamer ready
to make the dive, 'cordin' to my way of thinkin'. In the
first place, as I'm told, there are to be plenty of torpedoes
put in position inside the old hooker, an' it'll take some
time to made them ready. Anyway, you're snug as a bug
in a rug now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until Captain Miller comes aboard," Teddy interrupted.</p>

<p>"Have no fear of him," the little sailor said, as if the
subject was not worthy of consideration. "When he
comes, if he ever does, it isn't to this part of the ship
that he'll pay a visit. Officers spend their time aft, an'
small blame to 'em. It may be, Teddy Dunlap, that he'll
see you; but the chances are dead against it, so take all
the comfort you can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ought to be huntin' for daddy."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't, leastways, not while we're aboard this
craft, but you can count on comin' across him before
this little scrimmage is ended off Santiago, an' then I
warrant there'll be all the chance you need."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do on board here?" Teddy asked,
anxiously. "It don't stand to reason that we'll be allowed
to loaf around as if we owned the whole vessel."</p>

<p>"That's the way you look at it; but my idees are different.
Uncle Sam will keep us for a spell, that's certain,
an' until he gets tired of the job we needn't worry our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
heads. You might live to be a thousand years old without
strikin' another job as soft as the one we've got on
our hands this blessed minute, so I say, make the most
of it."</p>

<p>"It's different with you; but I'm only a stowaway, an'
stand a good show of gettin' into a heap of trouble when
the officers of this ship find out that I've no business to
be here."</p>

<p>"I don't figger that way," Bill Jones replied, with a
light and airy manner. "It doesn't stand to reason you
should have been left aboard to go down with the steamer,
eh?"</p>

<p>"They might have set me ashore."</p>

<p>"An' had a precious good job doin' it. Look ye, Teddy
Dunlap, are you countin' yourself of so much importance
that a battle-ship is to leave her station for no other reason
than to put you ashore?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it that way. You see they ought to do
somethin' with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then wait till they get ready, an' don't borrow trouble.
This crossin' of bridges before you come to 'em is likely
to make life mighty hard for a young chap like yourself,
an' considerin' all you've told me, I wonder at it."</p>

<p>Teddy could say nothing more. It surely seemed
reasonable Bill Jones knew what it was proper he should
do, and from that moment he resolved to "take things
easy," as his friend advised, rather than fret over what
couldn't be mended.</p>

<p>Therefore it was he ceased to worry, although at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
same time keeping a sharp watch over the <i>Brooklyn</i>, and
by such a course saw very much of what happened off
Santiago during those months of June and July, in the
year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight.</p>

<p>Surely the stowaway had no cause to complain of his
treatment by the crew of the <i>Texas</i>.</p>

<p>Every man did his best to make these waifs from the
doomed steamer feel perfectly at home, and when Bill
Jones brought his sea-chest aboard, as he did the day
following their abandonment of the <i>Merrimac</i>, there was
not a man on the battle-ship who did not suppose Teddy's
dunnage was in the same capacious receptacle.</p>

<p>Rations were served to the stowaway the same as to
any member of the crew, and then he and Bill Jones
were called upon for some trifling duty, but as the latter
said, there was no more work than was good for them
by way of exercise.</p>

<p>In the most pleasant fashion possible the time passed
until the <i>Merrimac</i> was made ready for her doom, and
these two comrades, for it can well be supposed they
were become fast friends, saw all the preparations without
being obliged to do any of the disagreeable work.</p>

<p>There was hardly an hour during these days of labour
when the two did not hear Lieutenant Hobson's plans
discussed, and they knew to the slightest detail all he
proposed to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-073" id="i-073"></a>
<img src="images/i-073.jpg" width="382" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Here is the way he'll sink our craft, 'cordin' to all
I've heard," Bill Jones said to Teddy when the two were
alone for a short time on the afternoon after it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
reported on board the <i>Texas</i> that everything was ready for
the desperate venture. "He'll run at about ten-knot speed
until four hundred yards or less past the Estrella battery,
or, in other words, till he's in the narrowest part of the
channel. Then he'll put the helm hard aport, stop the
engines, drop the anchors, open the sea connections, touch
off the torpedoes, an' leave the old hooker blockin' up the
entrance to Santiago Harbour."</p>

<p>"He can't do all that alone," Teddy suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course he can't, else why is he takin' a crew with
him? I'm told that this is the exact way he counts on
workin' it. There'll be four men on deck besides himself,
an' two in the engine-room; all of 'em will be stripped
down to their underclothes, an' with revolvers an' ammunition
strapped in water-tight packin' to their waists. One
will be forward with an axe to cut the lashings of the
anchor when the word is given. Of course Hobson signals
the engineers to stop the engines, then the fellow forward
cuts the anchor loose; some one below smashes the
sea connections with a sledge-hammer when the machinery
stops, and all hands jump overboard, countin' on swimmin'
to the boat that's bein' towed astern. The lieutenant himself
touches the button that explodes the torpedoes, an'
then over he goes; it's a case of every man for himself
once the work is begun. The steamer is bound to go
down athwart the channel, an' there you have the entrance
to Santiago Bay shut up as tight as Admiral Sampson
can wish."</p>

<p>Teddy did not venture any criticism. He had heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the subject discussed so often that there was nothing new
he could suggest, and it seemed wisest to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>On the close of this day word was passed among the
crew of the <i>Texas</i> that the venture would be made during
the coming night, and the two visitors from the <i>Merrimac</i>
were on deck from sunset until sunrise.</p>

<p>The work of preparing the big collier was continued
throughout the entire night, and just at daybreak she got
under way, as if to begin the voyage which it seemed
certain could end only with the death of all; but before
the men on the battle-ship had time to give her a parting
cheer, she put back to her station, because, as some of the
men declared, the admiral had given positive orders for
her to wait until another night.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours of additional preparation; as many of
speculation and discussion among those who were refused
an opportunity to offer their lives as a sacrifice, and
then came the moment when Teddy was awakened from
his sleep by Bill Jones, who said, as he shook the lad
roughly:</p>

<p>"Get on deck, my hearty, get on deck! This time
there'll be no mistake as to the sailin', an' if you want to
see the last of the <i>Merrimac</i>, now's your chance!"</p>

<p>The stowaway did not wait for a second invitation, and
a moment later he formed a small portion of the human
fringe which overhung the <i>Texas's</i> rail, peering out across
the waters where, by the pale light of the moon, could be
seen the doomed steamer.</p>

<p>It was even possible to distinguish the forms of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
crew as they stood well forward, much as though taking
a last look at the fleet, and, near at hand, the tiny launch
from the <i>New York</i>, which was to follow the collier in
with the hope of picking up some of her brave crew when
they leaped into the water.</p>

<p>Among all that throng of men on the <i>Texas</i> hardly
a word was spoken as the <i>Merrimac</i> slowly got under way.
Every one remained silent as if under the spell cast by
the bravery of those who were literally taking their lives
in their hands that the starry flag might wave triumphant.</p>

<p>Boldly the collier steamed in toward the coast, being
lost to view immediately she got under the shadow of the
high hills at the entrance of the bay, and a mile or more
astern the tiny launch puffed her way along as if conscious
that this morning's work was of extreme importance.</p>

<p>Then both craft were swallowed up by the gloom, and
yet that throng of men overhanging the <i>Texas's</i> rail
remained motionless, waiting with an anxiety that was
most intense for some sign which would give token of
their shipmates' fate.</p>

<p>During half an hour every man waited in keenest suspense,
never one venturing to so much as speak, and then
from the heights at the entrance of the harbour the flash
of a gun streamed out.</p>

<p>It came almost in the nature of a relief, for every one
knew that the <i>Merrimac</i> was nearing her destination at last.</p>

<p>The suspense was at an end, whatever might be the
result, and even Teddy Dunlap believed he could predict
the close of that most desperate venture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Within ten seconds after the first flash, another was
seen, then a third, and a fourth, until it was no longer
possible to count them.</p>

<p>The heights guarding the channel appeared to be
ablaze; but yet not a sound could be heard.</p>

<p>The blockading squadron were so far away that the
reports were lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Then the eager men found tongue, and it was as if
each spoke at the same instant, giving no heed as to
whether his neighbour replied.</p>

<p>During full twenty minutes these silent flashes could be
seen in the distance, and then they died away just as the
gray light of the coming dawn appeared in the eastern sky.</p>

<p>"It's all over!" Bill Jones said, as he laid his hand on
Teddy's shoulder. "I reckon the old <i>Merrimac</i> is layin'
in the channel to keep the Spaniards from sneakin' out;
but them as carried her in so bravely are past all troubles
of this world's makin'. It's great to be a hero; but the
glory of it is soon over!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they've all been killed?" Teddy
asked in a whisper, for it was much like speaking in the
presence of the dead.</p>

<p>"There's little doubt of it, lad. Think you a craft like
the <i>Merrimac</i> could stand the storm of shot and shell that
was poured on her from the time we saw the first flash?
Just bear in mind that every puff of flame betokened
a chunk of iron large enough to sink this 'ere battle-ship,
if it struck her fairly, an' you can have a fair idee of how
much chance those poor fellows stood."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-079" id="i-079"></a>
<img src="images/i-079.jpg" width="395" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Among all the crew there was hardly one who did not
share this opinion with Bill Jones. To them, the heroes
who went smilingly to their death had left this world
for ever, and yet the men continued to overhang the
rail, awaiting the return of the launch, with the idea
that when she arrived they might hear something of
importance.</p>

<p>Not until three hours later did the little craft show herself,
and then she came out from under the shadow of
the land followed by a shower of missiles from the big
guns ashore.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Texas</i> were forced to wait some time
before learning what information she brought, for the
launch went directly to the <i>New York</i>, as a matter of
course, and several hours elapsed before the crew heard
all that could then be told.</p>

<p>This was to the effect that the tiny boat followed the
collier until fire was opened upon the doomed steamer,
and she was so enshrouded by smoke as to be lost from
view. Then the launch was headed in under the batteries,
where she remained until daylight on the lookout
for a swimmer.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the morning no sign of life had been
seen, and the little craft made for the fleet, followed by a
rain of shot from the shore batteries.</p>

<p>While crossing the harbour entrance one spar of the
<i>Merrimac</i> was seen sticking out of the water, and thus it
was known that the little band of braves had done their
work faithfully, at whatever cost to themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>There was neither jest nor careless word among the
crew of the battle-ship during this forenoon; even Bill
Jones remained almost absolutely silent. It seemed that
they stood in the presence of death, and more than one
acted as if believing he was taking part in the funeral
services of those who had so lately been among them.</p>

<p>Teddy had seen every man who went to make up that
devoted crew, and to him it was as if his personal friends
had met their death; but in such a brave fashion that it
would have been almost a crime to mourn their taking
off.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash of lightning from a clear sky, came
the joyful news that every man among that band who had
devoted themselves to death, was yet among the living,
and comparatively uninjured.</p>

<p>It was almost incredible information, and yet, because of
its source, no one could doubt it.</p>

<p>At two hours past noon, while the men of the <i>Texas</i>
were sheltering themselves from the burning rays of the
sun and discussing for the hundredth time the last probable
moments of their shipmates, a steam-launch, carrying
a white flag, put out from the harbour, making directly for
the flag-ship <i>New York</i>.</p>

<p>At the time no one fancied for a single moment that
the coming of this craft could have any connection with
those who had left the station to wreck the <i>Merrimac</i>,
but there were some who suggested that the Spaniards
were ready to surrender, and, in support of this theory,
cited the fact that the royal squadron was bottled up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
so tightly it could never be used against the United
States.</p>

<p>Others declared that the Spanish admiral was about to
make an offer of compromise, and not a few believed the
flag of truce had to do with the capitulation of the city of
Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>Not a man was prepared for the news which floated
from ship to ship, no one could say exactly how; but in
less than an hour from the time the launch made fast
alongside the <i>New York</i>,
it was known that she brought
a message from Admiral Cervera,
commander of the Spanish fleet, to the effect that the
crew of the <i>Merrimac</i> had been captured, and were held
as prisoners of war.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-083" id="i-083"></a>
<img src="images/i-083.jpg" width="474" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Hobson was uninjured, and only two of the
party had been wounded slightly.</p>

<p>It seemed too good to be true, but when the men
realised that this information must be correct, that it had
been sent by a generous enemy, they spent a good five
minutes cheering alternately for those who had escaped
after having gone down into the very jaws of death, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
for that gallant Spaniard who, recognising bravery even in
his foe, had taken the trouble to announce the safety of
those who were battling against him.</p>

<p>"It's what I call a mighty fine thing for the old admiral
to do," Bill Jones said, as he held forth to a gun's crew
with whom he and Teddy messed. "It ain't every officer
as would go out of his way to send such news as that, an'
if Admiral Cervera should ever fall into my hands as a
prisoner of war, he can count on bein' treated like a white
man."</p>

<p>There was a roar from Bill's auditors at the intimation
that the commander of the Spanish fleet might ever be
captured by that sailor, for by this time all had come to
know him as a "plain, every-day sailor, with not a fightin'
timber in him;" but not a man within sound of his voice
cared to contradict him.</p>

<p>On that night, after the subject of the venture and its
sequel had been discussed until worn threadbare, the little
sailor said to Teddy, as if telling him some important
truth:</p>

<p>"You'll see great doin's now, lad, an' it wouldn't give
me such a terrible surprise to know that the war was
ended within the next twenty-four hours, for them
bloomin' Spaniards in Santiago must understand by
this time that the sooner they give in whipped, the less
of a lickin' they're like to get."</p>

<p>And Teddy, thinking more of his own condition than
the glory of the country, asked, with no slight distress of
mind:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>"If it should come to a stop as soon as that, how could
I ever get word to father? Of course the <i>Brooklyn</i> would
go right home, an' I'd be left here."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that, lad," Bill Jones replied, in a tone
of assurance. "Never you have a fear but that I'll see
she don't leave this station till you've had a chance to go
on board long enough to sort out the coal-passers."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="s08">THE CHASE.</span></h2>

<p>Bill Jones found time to change his opinion as to
the speedy termination of the war after the <i>Merrimac</i>
had been sunk at the entrance of Santiago Bay.</p>

<p>Instead of displaying any anxiety to surrender, the
Spaniards on the island appeared to be making every
preparation for a stubborn defence, and the fleet of war-vessels
had little opportunity to do much more than
blockade duty.</p>

<p>Teddy Dunlap, looked upon by the crew of the <i>Texas</i> as
a lad who had every right to be among them, might have
enjoyed this cruising to and fro, keeping watch over the
entrance to the harbour, now and then overhauling a suspicious-looking
vessel that ventured too near, and at times
throwing shells ashore from the big guns, but for the
fact that he burned with impatience to be with his
father.</p>

<p>The <i>Brooklyn</i> remained in view nearly all the time,
now so close at hand that it seemed as if the two ships
must immediately come within hailing distance, and again
so far away that she appeared only as a tiny speck
against the white sky, yet the stowaway was as completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
separated from his father as if they were thousands of
miles apart.</p>

<p>"If only the captains couldn't talk with those little
flags, it might be that the ships would come side by
side!" he said, with a long-drawn sigh, to Bill Jones.
"There'll never be any need for them to sail nearer than
within sight, an' I won't get a chance to speak to father,&mdash;perhaps
not this year."</p>

<p>"The prospect don't look very encouragin' just at the
present time, an' that's a fact," Bill said, thoughtfully,
filling his pipe with unusual care. "Two or three days
ago it seemed as if the war was mighty nigh at an end; but
now there 'pears to be a good deal of fight left in the
Dagoes."</p>

<p>"An' while we're loafin' 'round here, Captain Miller
will come aboard some fine day. Then where'll I be?"</p>

<p>"Right here, my lad, an' there's no use lookin' ahead.
He won't come the sooner, or stay away any longer, no
matter how much you fuss, so why not save the wear an'
tear of thinkin'?"</p>

<p>"See here," and Teddy leaned forward to look the little
sailor full in the eyes, "do you believe I'll ever have
a chance of lettin' daddy know where I am?"</p>

<p>"It stands to reason there must be a show for it in
course of time."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Now you're askin' me a question I ain't in condition
to answer. It may be two or three weeks, or, then again,
the show might come sudden, within an hour. At sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
you can't ever tell what's goin' to happen, Teddy Dunlap,
an' there's nothin' for it but to keep your ears an' eyes
open all the time, ready to jump on the first promisin'
chance that comes your way."</p>

<p>There is no good reason why such a conversation as this
should be set down, save that it is similar to a hundred
others which were held between the two comrades during
the weeks which followed the sinking of the <i>Merrimac</i>,
when Teddy Dunlap, without effort on his part, was transformed
from a stowaway to a lad apparently in the employ
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Never for a single moment did he lose sight of the
possible fact that either the <i>Brooklyn</i> or the <i>Texas</i> might
be ordered away from this particular station, in which
case it was reasonable to suppose that many months
must elapse before he could inform his father of his
whereabouts.</p>

<p>There was grave danger the two might be separated
so widely that months, perhaps years, would elapse before
they could meet again, and Teddy was never comfortable
in mind, but, despite all the good advice given by Bill
Jones, continued to look out into the future, searching for
trouble.</p>

<p>Meanwhile both he and the little sailor were kept at
work on board the <i>Texas</i> exactly as if they had been
regularly enlisted; but the duties were so light among
such a large number, that he who complained of the work
must indeed have been an indolent fellow.</p>

<p>And while Teddy worried over his own seeming troubles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the two nations continued at war, killing and wounding
men at every opportunity, and ever striving to strike some
decisive blow.</p>

<p>As a matter of course Teddy and Bill Jones took their
small part in the bombardment of the batteries at the
entrance to Santiago Harbour two days after the <i>Merrimac</i>
had been sunk.</p>

<p>The <i>Texas</i> was the third vessel in the first column,
headed by the <i>Brooklyn</i>, when, shortly after sunrise, the
fleet steamed inshore and opened fire with the heavy
guns.</p>

<p>It was to the boy as if he went into action almost by
the side of his father, and he worked with a will at whatsoever
was set him to do, although at times the terrific
roar literally stunned him, while the heat was so great
that it seemed as if he was on the verge of suffocation
during every moment of the four hours the bombardment
continued.</p>

<p>Then the squadron steamed back to its blockading
station, and at no time had the <i>Brooklyn</i> and <i>Texas</i> been
so near each other as to have rendered it possible for
Teddy to see his father, even though the latter had stood
on the battle-ship's deck every moment.</p>

<p>Again and again, as the days passed, did the <i>Texas</i>
go into action, and at no time were the little stowaway and
his small comrade remiss in their duties.</p>

<p>They did their full share of the work, despite Bill
Jones's assertion that he was only a "plain, every-day
sailor with no fightin' timber about him," and as the weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
wore on these two became more and more closely identified
with the battle-ship to which chance had sent them.</p>

<p>When the ship was sent to bombard the works at
Matamoras, and a Spanish shell struck near the stern on
the port side, passing through the hull three feet below
the main-deck line, and exploding on the berth-deck, killing
one man and wounding eight, Teddy's search for his
father nearly came to an end.</p>

<p>A fragment of the shell passed within ten inches of the
boy's head, striking
down a sailor
just beyond him,
and Teddy won
the admiration of
every man on
board by springing
to the relief
of the poor fellow
whose leg
had been shattered, instead of taking flight, as might quite
naturally have been expected.</p>

<img src="images/i-090.jpg" width="381" height="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Later, when the <i>Texas</i> had withdrawn from the action,
man after man congratulated the lad upon his behaviour,
predicting that he would in time prove himself worthy of
serving under such a commander as Captain Philip, and
otherwise bestowing so much praise that at the first
opportunity he said confidentially to Bill Jones:</p>

<p>"It makes me ashamed to have them say so much about
how I acted. It wasn't different from what any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
feller would have done, because I forgot all about the
danger when Baker fell."</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin' you're out of your reckonin' there, lad,
for accordin' to my idee, there ain't a boy in a thousand
who'd handled himself as well as you did. Now I'm no
fightin' man, as I've said before, but your keepin' such
a stiff upper lip, when there was precious good chance of
bein' killed, did me solid good. I knew you had sand,
from the first minute of settin' eyes on you, but never
suspected there was so much of it."</p>

<p>"You're talkin' worse than the others, even when I'm
tellin' the truth about not knowin' there was any danger.
I only saw poor Baker, an' thought I might help
him."</p>

<p>"It ain't what you thought, lad, but what you did, that
counts, an' now if Captain Miller comes aboard I'm willin'
to guarantee he won't be allowed to kick up any row
because of your stowin' away on the <i>Merrimac</i>. The crew
wouldn't allow any funny business with you, after this
day's work. Don't you see how much nearer your father
we are than we were this mornin'?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say, lad. You've made for yourself a
standin' on board this ship, an' now when the time comes
right I'm goin' to tell your story to one of the petty
officers, askin' him to see it reaches Captain Philip's ears.
Once that's been done, Teddy Dunlap, we'll be hailin' the
<i>Brooklyn</i> with signals flyin' to tell the coal-passers that
one of 'em has got a son on board this craft."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose any such plan might work?" Teddy
asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"There ain't a shadow of doubt about it in my mind."</p>

<p>"Why don't you do it now? I've given up hopin' this
war is pretty near at an end, an' am hungry to see daddy."</p>

<p>"Better wait awhile longer, my boy. It's a little too
soon to show ourselves very big, 'cause it ain't no ways
certain the captain has had time to hear of what you did.
We'll hold off a spell, an' then, when the signs come right,
you'll see me put this business along in great shape."</p>

<p>Because of this promise, and also owing to the many
words of praise which were showered upon him by the
men, Teddy Dunlap believed, as he had several times
before, that the hour was very near at hand when he
would be with his father once more; but, as in the past,
he was doomed to disappointment during more days than
he cared to count.</p>

<p>The "signs" never came so nearly right as to give Bill
Jones courage to take the responsibility of telling Teddy's
story to those who would repeat it to Captain Philip, and
these two refugees from the <i>Merrimac</i> remained aboard
the <i>Texas</i>, much to the satisfaction of the crew.</p>

<p>It was known to them, as to every one on the warships,
that hot fighting was going on ashore in the vicinity of
Santiago, and at frequent intervals the big vessels steamed
toward the land, in this direction or that, to shell the
Spanish camps; but they were at such a distance from
the scene of action that such work had little the appearance
of warfare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, the air of plain, every-day business about the
operations rendered it difficult to believe the huge shot
and shell which were hurled landward carried in their
wake death and destruction to many.</p>

<p>When one of the <i>Texas's</i> big guns was discharged,
Teddy could hear the roar, and feel the concussion, as
a matter of course; he could also see the missile as it sped
through the air; but he had no means of knowing where
it struck, neither did he have a view of the desolation and
ruin it caused, therefore, like many another man aboard
the battle-ship, he came to look upon this work of war as
nothing more than harmless practice.</p>

<p>The day was near at hand, however, when the stowaway
and his little comrade were to have all too good a
view of the butchery and inhumanity of war.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday morning, the third day of July.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Texas</i> had been mustered for religious
services, and while Bill Jones and Teddy waited in their
proper places for the coming of the chaplain, the sailor
whispered:</p>

<p>"To-morrow mornin' I'm goin' to start in on your business,
lad. So far as I can see, the fleet is likely to be
here a year or more before the Spaniards are ready to
surrender Santiago, and if I don't bring you to the captain's
notice soon, all your good behaviour when the shot
came aboard will have been forgotten."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we've waited too long already," the lad
replied, with a sigh, for the hope had been so long deferred
that his "heart was sick" indeed for a sight of his father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon not, Teddy; but if I've made a mistake in
holdin' off, it was done through fear I might speak too
soon."</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm blamin' you," the boy replied, quickly,
pressing his comrade's arm in a friendly fashion. "If
you never did anything more, I'd feel as if you'd been
mighty good to me, for I couldn't have run across many
sailors who'd lay themselves out to help a stowaway."</p>

<p>"That part of it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill Jones was interrupted by a shout,&mdash;Teddy will
never know who uttered it, or what the words were,&mdash;and
instantly, without the slightest apparent cause, all
was seeming confusion on board the ship.</p>

<p>It was to the lad as if the very air bristled with excitement;
he saw men darting here and there, heard sharp,
quick words of command, and as if at the very same instant,
the <i>Texas</i> seemed to leap forward with a bound, huge
clouds of black smoke suddenly pouring out of her stacks.</p>

<p>"The Spaniards! The Spaniards!" Bill Jones yelled
in the lad's ear, at the same time pointing toward the
entrance to the harbour, from out of which could be seen
the dark hull of an enemy's ship.</p>

<p>It was as if in that small fraction of time very much
took place.</p>

<p>Teddy saw long lines of signal-flags run up to the <i>Brooklyn's</i>
masthead; he heard the roar of a 6-pounder as the
<i>Iowa</i> fired the first shot at the foe, and understood, rather
than saw, that every vessel in the squadron was under a
full head of steam almost immediately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>At one instant the blockading squadron lay motionless
and apparently lifeless off the harbour, rocking lazily on the
long swell, and then, before one could speak, as it were,
every listless hull was a war machine, quivering with life,
and pouring forth deadly shot and shell.</p>

<p>The transformation was so sudden and complete that it
is little wonder Teddy and Bill Jones stood transfixed with
astonishment until the chase was well under way.</p>

<p>One after another of the Spanish cruisers came at full
speed out of the harbour which it had been believed was
closed by the hull of the <i>Merrimac</i>, and as each ship
rounded the point her guns were discharged at the Yankee
squadron. The dense smoke pouring out of their
stacks; the clouds of spray from their bows, glistening
like diamonds in the sunlight of that Sabbath morning as
it was thrown aft by the fierce impetus of the huge vessels
to mingle with the smoke that came from every gun; the
roar and thunder of the discharges; the shrieking of the
missiles, and the spouting of water as the metal fell short,
made up a scene of war in its most terrific phase.</p>

<p>On the other side, three battle-ships and an armoured
cruiser dashing forward at the full speed of their engines;
the heavy reverberations of guns; black clouds and white
of smoke from coal and from burning powder; men stripped
to the waist and working at the pieces with a fury, haste,
and energy that could not have been increased had each
individual member of the crew been fighting against a
personal foe, and words of command, encouragement, or
hope, which were heard on every hand, thrilled the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
who had trembled before the supposed wrath of a collier's
captain, until each nerve was tingling with excitement,&mdash;each
pulse bounding with the hot blood that leaped in
feverish throbs from artery to artery.</p>

<p>Teddy Dunlap was in the very midst of what but few
had ever seen,&mdash;a sea-battle with the mightiest ships in
the world as combatants.</p>

<p>It was while the lad and his elderly comrade stood like
statues, gazing at the wondrous, terrible sight around
them, that the former saw a huge shell leave the turret
of the <i>Iowa</i>, rise on the arc of a circle in the air, cleaving
its way directly toward the <i>Teresa</i>, the foremost of the
fleeing ships.</p>

<p>Teddy was still following the missile with his eyes when
it struck the Spaniard's hull, cutting its way through as if
no resistance was offered, and it seemed that the huge
mass had but just disappeared when great volumes of
smoke and flame burst from the aperture made by the
shell, telling that the first of the enemy's fleet was already
vanquished.</p>

<p>Then came a mighty yell from every man aboard the
<i>Texas</i> as well as the <i>Iowa</i>, for the gun had been aimed
with a precision worthy a Yankee gunner whose forefathers,
perhaps, had been forced to shoot accurately in
order to save their scalps from the lurking Indian.</p>

<p>This cry of satisfaction had not yet died away when the
<i>Maria Teresa</i> was headed for the beach, with smoke and
flame enveloping all her after part,&mdash;a wreck before she
had more than cleared the harbour's mouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"There's one of 'em done for, an' in short order!"
Bill Jones screamed, dancing to and fro like a crazy person,
and if he made any further remark Teddy failed to
hear it, because of the cheers of triumph which came from
every vessel in the American fleet.</p>

<p>The enemy had counted on cutting his way through the
blockading squadron, but the first of his vessels had come
to grief before the chase was fairly begun.</p>

<p>As the <i>Teresa</i> swung round in order to gain shoal
water before the fire should completely envelop her,
Teddy saw two small, swift, low-lying steamers come out
from behind her with a speed which seemed like that of
the wind, and the little sailor cried, in tones nearly resembling
fear:</p>

<p>"There are the destroyers! The <i>Pluton</i> and <i>Furor</i>!
Our ships are not speedy enough to keep out of their
way! Now is the Spaniard's chance to pay for the loss
of the <i>Teresa</i>!"</p>

<p>Teddy had heard of these torpedo-boats, and knew what
it was possible for them to do unless, perchance, they
might be checked at long range, and yet the commanders
of the Yankee battle-ships apparently gave no heed to
the dangerous enemies which had been designed for the
sole purpose of destroying such as they.</p>

<p>Straight toward the <i>Brooklyn</i> these formidable craft
were headed, and the stowaway involuntarily cried aloud
in terror, for was not his father on board that vessel which
appeared to be in such peril?</p>

<p>Then, coming up swiftly, as a hawk darts out upon its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
prey, the lad saw the little yacht <i>Gloucester</i> swim directly
inshore to meet these mighty engines of destruction,
when one well-directed shot from their guns would have
sent her to the bottom, crushed out of all semblance of a
vessel.</p>

<p>At that moment Teddy and Bill Jones saw what much
resembled the attack of a fly upon two huge spiders.</p>

<p>The tiny <i>Gloucester</i> steamed straight down upon the
destroyers, cutting them off from their intended prey, and
pelting them with shells from her small 6-pounders, but
doing the work with such accuracy and precision of aim
that it seemed as if the battle was no more than begun
before these two mighty machines turned toward the shore
to follow the <i>Teresa</i>, but sinking even while one could
say they were beaten.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Wainwright! Bully little <i>Gloucester</i>!"</p>

<p>Two hundred voices rose high with shouts of triumph
and exultation that the Yankee gunners had not only done
their work well, but with bravery such as could not be
excelled, and meanwhile the big ships went tearing madly
on lest the <i>Vizcaya</i>, the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>, and the <i>Almirante
Oquendo</i>, all that were left of the Spanish fleet, should
escape them.</p>

<p>The <i>Iowa</i> and the <i>Texas</i> had selected the <i>Vizcaya</i> as
their prey, and while the remainder of the fleet stretched
away in pursuit of the other ships, these two cut off the
big Spaniard, forcing her to fight whether she liked or
not.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-099" id="i-099"></a>
<img src="images/i-099.jpg" width="380" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Teddy and Bill Jones stood on the port side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
<i>Texas</i>, all unconscious that they were exposed to any
chance shot the Spaniard might send aboard, and realising
nothing save the fever of battle. The odour of burning
powder was in their nostrils, and life or death, danger or
safety were alike the same.</p>

<p>The <i>Texas</i> literally reeled under their feet as her big
guns were discharged full at the <i>Vizcaya</i>, which ship was
hurling shot and shell with reckless rapidity and inaccuracy
of aim.</p>

<p>The roar of the pieces was like the crashing of thunder;
the vibrations of the air smote one like veritable blows,
and enormous smoke clouds rolled here and there, now
shutting off all view, and again lifting to reveal the enemy
in his desperate but ill-directed flight.</p>

<p>"Can we sink her?" Teddy asked once, when the two
comrades were so closely enveloped by the pungent
vapour that it was impossible to distinguish objects five
feet away, and the little sailor cried, in a delirium of
excitement:</p>

<p>"Sink her, lad? That's what we're bound to do!"</p>

<p>"She is workin' her guns for all they are worth, an'
I've heard it said that even a ship like this would go
down if a big shell struck fairly."</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, an' so she would, I reckon; but we'll have
yonder Spaniard under the water before her gunners can
get the range. Every shot of ours is hittin' its mark, an'
they're not comin' within half a mile of us! Sink her!
We'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as Bill Jones spoke, the 12-inch gun in the <i>Texas's</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
forward turret was discharged. The smoke rolled aside
at the same instant, and the two watchers saw a huge shell
dart forth, speeding directly toward the ship that had so
lately been a friendly visitor in the harbour of New York.</p>

<p>It struck its mark fairly, crashed through the iron
plating as if through paper, and then Teddy saw the
mighty vessel reel under her death-stroke when the shell
exploded.</p>

<p>Another howl of triumph; half naked men danced to
and fro in their excitement; the gunners rushed out from
the turrets gasping for breath, but yelling with savage joy,
and the <i>Vizcaya's</i> bow was headed toward the shore!</p>

<p>The fourth vessel of the enemy's fleet had been disabled,
and there only remained the two mighty ships in
the distance, from the smoke-stacks of which poured forth
long rolls of black smoke, flecked with sparks and burning
brands, that told of the desperate efforts being made to
escape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="s08">TEDDY'S DADDY.</span></h2>

<p>The <i>Maria Teresa</i> and the <i>Vizcaya</i> were in flames,
heading for shoal water that they might not carry
down with their blackened hulks the men who had defended
them, although feebly, and there was no longer any
reason why the <i>Texas</i> should remain in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The <i>Iowa</i> swung inshore to make certain the ruin was
as complete as it appeared from the distance, and when
the royal ensign was hauled down that a white flag might
be hoisted on the <i>Vizcaya</i>, Captain Philip gave the word
which sent the <i>Texas</i> ahead in chase after the survivors
of what had, less than half an hour previous, been a
mighty fleet.</p>

<p>As one who witnessed the battle has already written
concerning this particular time and the wonderfully one-sided
engagement, his words had best be quoted:</p>

<p>"Huge volumes of black smoke, edged with red flame,
rolled from every port and shot-hole of the <i>Vizcaya</i>, as
from the <i>Teresa</i>. They were both furnaces of glowing
fire. Though they had come from the harbour to certain
battle, not a wooden bulkhead, not a partition in the
quarters either of officers or men had been taken out, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
had trunks and chests been sent ashore. Neither had
the wooden decks or any other wooden fixtures been
prepared to resist fire. Apparently the crew had not
even wet down the decks."</p>

<p>It was the experience of a full lifetime, to witness the
destruction of these four fighting-machines, and yet Teddy
Dunlap and his little comrade almost forgot what they
had seen in the excitement of the race, as their ship
leaped forward in that mad chase which was to end only
with the wrecking of all those vessels that had sailed out
of the harbour to make their way past the Yankee
fleet.</p>

<p>The two comrades were conscious of nothing save the
throbbing and quivering of their own ship, as, under press
of every ounce of steam that could be raised, the <i>Texas</i>
dashed onward, overhauling first this Yankee vessel and
then that, flinging the spray in showers over her deck,
and rolling from side to side in the heavy swell as she
tore onward at a rate of speed that probably she had
never before equalled.</p>

<p>It was a race to the death; now and then the hatches
were opened that some one of the engineer's crew, exhausted
by almost superhuman efforts and the excessive
heat, might be brought up from those fiery depths below,
while others took the place of him who had fallen at the
post of duty, and the speed was never slackened.</p>

<p>On, on, over the long swell, every man aboard in the
highest possible state of excitement, eager that the <i>Texas</i>
should be in at the death, and ahead, straining every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
nerve as it were, fled the Spaniards, knowing full well
that there could be but one ending to such a race.</p>

<p>"It's Yankee grit an' Yankee skill that's winnin' this
fight!" Bill Jones cried, excitedly, forgetting that he
was only a "plain, every-day sailor, with no fightin'
timber about him," and at every onward leap of the
ship his body swayed forward as if he was eager for a
fray.</p>

<p>But neither Bill Jones nor any man aboard the <i>Texas</i>,
save those brave souls in the very bowels of the gallant
ship, had any opportunity to display personal bravery.</p>

<p>The fight ended when the chase did, for then nothing
was left of those mighty Spanish ships save blackened
hulks.</p>

<p>The <i>Oregon</i> was sending 13-inch projectiles after the
<i>Oquendo</i> at every fair opportunity, and the <i>Texas</i>, more
than holding her own with the other vessels, was coming
up astern with a speed that threatened to bring the long
race to a speedy conclusion.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, although all had been expecting it,
the <i>Almirante Oquendo's</i> bow was headed toward the
shore,&mdash;she saw the uselessness of further flight,&mdash;and
all the pursuers, save the <i>Texas</i>, hauled off in pursuit of
the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>.</p>

<p>Standing with a group of <i>Texas</i> men, Teddy and
Bill Jones saw the Spaniard near the line of surf, and
as their vessel's speed was checked there came a roar
mightier than when the battle was first opened; the
doomed ship rocked to and fro as if she had struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
a sunken reef, there was an uprending of the iron
decks, and then came a shower of fragments that told
of the tremendous explosion within the hull of the
<i>Oquendo</i>.</p>

<p>Now it was the Yankee crew burst once more into
shouts of triumph; but before the first cheer arose on the
morning air Captain Philip cried:</p>

<p>"Don't cheer; the poor devils are dying!"</p>

<p>Then it was that every man realised what had, until
this moment, been absolutely forgotten: the game in
which they were such decided victors was one of death!
While they were triumphantly happy, scores upon scores
of the enemy were dying,&mdash;mangled, scalded, drowning,&mdash;and
on the instant, like a flash of light, came the terrible
fact that while they rejoiced, others were suffering a last
agony.</p>

<p>"Don't cheer; the poor devils are dying!"</p>

<p>At that instant Teddy Dunlap understood what might
be the horror of war, and forgetting the joy and exultation
which had been his an instant previous, the lad covered
his eyes with his hand,&mdash;sick at heart that he should have
taken even a passive part in that game which could be
ended only by suffering and death.</p>

<p>Later, after the men were sufficiently calm to be able
to discuss intelligently the doings of that day when the
full Spanish fleet was destroyed by Yankee vessels who
throughout all the action and chase sustained no injury
whatsoever, it was learned that more than six hundred
human beings had been sent out of the world in less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
four hours, and nearly eighteen hundred men were taken
prisoners by the American vessels.</p>

<p>Teddy Dunlap was like one in a daze from the instant
he realised what all this thrilling excitement meant, until
Bill Jones, who had been ordered to some duty below,
came to his side in the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, lad?" he cried, shaking
the boy vigorously as he pointed seaward, and Teddy,
looking in the direction indicated by his outstretched
finger, but without seeing anything, asked, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Is it the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>?"</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't, my lad! That vessel is a wreck off
Tarquino Point, so we heard half an hour ago. Don't you
see the ship here almost alongside?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see her," Teddy replied, with a sigh of
relief. "There's been so much that is terrible goin' on
around us that it's like as if I was dazed."</p>

<p>"An' that's what you must be, lad, not to see that here's
the <i>Brooklyn</i> nearer alongside than she's like to come again
for a year or more."</p>

<p>"The <i>Brooklyn</i>!" Teddy cried, now aroused from the
stupefaction of horror which had come upon him with
the knowledge of all the suffering caused that day. "The
<i>Brooklyn</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, an' her launch is alongside makin' ready to
transfer some of the prisoners. Now's our chance, when
such as we don't amount to a straw in view of the great
things that have been done this day, to slip over on a little
visit to your daddy!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Probably at no other time could such a thing have been
done by two members of the crew; but just now, when
every man and officer was overwhelmed by the fever
of victory, little heed was given to the movements of any
particular person.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that Teddy Dunlap and the little
sailor had no difficulty in gaining the <i>Brooklyn's</i> deck
without question or check, and the first person they saw
on clambering aboard was a coal-passer, stripped to the
waist and grimy with dust and perspiration, who stared
with bulging eyes at the boy who followed close behind
Bill Jones.</p>

<p>"Teddy!"</p>

<p>"Daddy!"</p>

<p>"I reckon this is no place for me," Bill Jones muttered
as he made his way forward, and if the "plain,
every-day sailor with no fightin' timber about him"
had sufficient delicacy to leave father and son alone at
such a time, surely we should show ourselves equally
considerate.</p>

<p class="p2">It is enough to say that Teddy's troubles were at an
end after a short visit with his father, and that he did not
leave the <i>Texas</i> immediately.</p>

<p>Captain Philip came to hear the boy's story, and an
opportunity was given him to enlist for so long a term as
his father was bound to the <i>Brooklyn</i>.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of this little story was only to tell
how the stowaway found his father, there is no excuse

home shall be set down with careful fidelity to every
